                    During this time, due to the pandemic, the school implemented a half-day schedule with attendance limits for morning assemblies,
                     allowing only one or two forms to enter the Hall D at a time. As a result, her work was quite light and easy. As a trainee, 
                     Modo spent the entire semester mainly performing patroling duties.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">During the student council Q&A session, the first major event for ITP this year, 
                  Modo was unexpectedly assigned to on-site duty due to Mr. Yeung’s lack of oversight. She collaborated with Hin for the
                   first time and met Ms. Kwong, who was in charge of Hall A. The event concluded successfully, but unfortunately, many attendees were dissatisfied with their performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Since the beginning of 2022, Mr. Yeung’s behavior had caused dissatisfaction among many teachers and students. 
                  Over time, they began to associate the entire ITP team with his shortcomings, leading to misplaced anger directed towards them. Modo felt frustrated because if this continued, 
                  the ITP department might be disbanded. Having come to see this place as her second home, she did not want to lose her sanctuary. To change the situation, Modo decided to report 
                  everything to Ms. Lai, including the delay in announcing the Form Head list.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">For the first time, Modo experienced the challenges of having a demotivating supervisor. Knowing that being the whistleblower might not yield positive results,
                   she still took this step for the team and began to understand how the workplace operates.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">At this time, there were already two factions forming: the old faction led by Ms. Lai, including Modo, Hin, and others studying ICT under Ms. Lai; and the new faction led by Mr. Yeung, 
                  composed of ITP members he personally invited to join.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">After learning about everything that had transpired over the year, Ms. Lai decided to hold a review meeting—the first of its kind for ITP in many years. 
                  The meeting primarily addressed the issues of order in the control room and behavior, 
                  subtly indicating to Mr. Yeung the responsibilities he should uphold. She announced that the new personnel appointments would be revealed on 2023/01/30.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Modo felt the benefits of having a good relationship with her senior manager, but her rapport with Ms. Lai was genuine and not simply for personal gain.</p>

                   to oversee the control room operations. Sunny often chatted with Modo, mainly about Mr. Yeung, and invited her to visit the server room, which she found friendly and approachable.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">Modo's largest event in her ITP career was entrusted to her by Ms. Lai, assigning her the responsibility of managing the sound 
                  in the auditorium. Despite feeling familiar with the equipment after a year of training, she still felt nervous during the event. Fortunately, thanks to the
                   synergy with Hin and Ms. Lai's guidance, the event proceeded smoothly. Modo received positive feedback from many teachers about ITP, successfully restoring some of its reputation.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">Like an awards ceremony, the graduation ceremony was fully managed by Modo, allowing her to gain significant experience and aiding her promotion path.
                   Additionally, it garnered positive feedback for ITP, particularly from Ms. Tang, who had previously been critical of the department. She even praised Modo's outstanding performance to 
                   Ms. Lai, increasing Modo's promotion chances.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">However, Modo remained aware that ITP was no longer under Ms. Lai's leadership, understanding that her promotion opportunities ultimately depended on Mr. Yeung. 
                  This was the first time she felt the overwhelming and daunting nature of workplace power dynamics.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">Mr. Yeung required all ITP members to fill out an annual survey, ostensibly to understand the work situation this year. 
                  However, Modo saw through the true purpose of the survey: he wanted to identify who was dissatisfied with him and whom he could recruit into his faction.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Since the survey was named, Modo completed it half-heartedly. She successfully and richly navigated through her year in ITP.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">This day was originally scheduled for the promotion ceremony and announcements, but due to Mr. Yeung's negligence, it was nearly canceled. 
                  Modo felt very anxious because she had not yet confirmed her promotion to School Head. After Modo strongly advocated to Ms. Lai, she successfully postponed both matters by a month.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">After the weekly assembly, Modo could no longer hold back and decided to ask Hin about the situation. Hin sighed, relieved that someone 
                  had finally noticed, and revealed to Modo the secret he had discovered: Sunny was already married but was having an affair with Vivian, even taking leave together to travel.
                   Although this did not concern the ITP team, Modo felt very disappointed in Sunny. Hin even advised Modo to stay away from him and exposed the fact that Sunny was two-faced.
                    He appeared enthusiastic in inviting students into the server room, but when discovered, he would shift the blame onto others.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">At this moment, Modo decided to write a novel after graduation to commemorate the events of the past three years, titled "ITP Survival Diary."</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Modo felt completely disillusioned with this workplace. She once believed that there could be genuine relationships in the workplace, but in reality, 
                  you could be stabbed in the back by someone and still thank them. At the same time, she felt angry about having to become two-faced herself.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">After class, Modo ran into Hin, who told her that he had informed Ms. Lai about everything. He also pointed out that there was an unauthorized 
                  camera in the control room directly connected to Sunny's phone. Ms. Lai was aware of it but lacked the ability to resolve the issue. At that moment, Modo had a bold idea: as
                   School Head, she had the responsibility to protect the privacy of every IT Prefect. She decided to find an opportunity to cut the power to the camera and shared this plan with Hin.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Modo had always believed that this action was inappropriate, but when she found herself in a situation where even her supervisor could not help the team, 
                  she decided to step up and take action. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>

                <h2 class="timeline-content-date">2024/01/16</h2>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">After the morning assembly, Modo and Hin were the only ones left in the control room. Modo quickly covered the camera with paper and disconnected the power. 
                  She had a backup plan: if the camera had memory, they would know who the "culprit" was. Modo would explain that the situation was too chaotic, and she accidentally unplugged the power cord.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">(In retrospect: Modo realized that she was no different from others in the workplace, all capable of playing “games.” Yet, she believed her actions were for the good of the team.
                   On one hand, she felt anger towards her own methods; on the other, she felt proud to contribute to the team.)</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">After the incident, Hin informed Modo that Sunny had personally brought someone in last year to lighten the IT department's workload. However, that person upset Sunny, and he began to bully him at work, 
                  ordering him to replace the network cables in every classroom in the school. In the end, he even framed him to Ms. Lai, leading to his dismissal.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">(Modo felt the harshness of the workplace and the ugliness of human nature once again.)</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">Modo had been diligently preparing for the DSE, and her ITP work was progressing smoothly. It was only after the event that she found a moment 
                  to chat with Hin about the recent developments. Hin revealed that one day, while entering the server room as usual, he had witnessed Sunny and Vivian engaged in intimate acts. 
                  That same day, he reported the incident to the principal, who subsequently reprimanded both of them.Upon hearing this, Modo felt a wave of discomfort wash over her. 
                  This meant that Sunny was now aware that Hin had uncovered his secret, and since Modo was part of the same team as Hin, she risked being implicated as well.
                   Yet, despite her unease, Modo felt a sense of resolve; she had anticipated that this day might come.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Hin mentioned that workplace bullying had been happening for a while; Modo just hadn’t had the chance to talk to him about it. Fortunately, 
                  after working diligently at the school for a year, Hin had built up a considerable network. So, when Sunny planned to resort to his old tricks to frame him, Ms. Lai could help 
                  protect Hin’s position amidst the rumors.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">(Modo used to believe that it wasn’t necessary to establish connections with many people in the workplace, but through this experience, she realized the power of networking.)</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">For Modo, this was the last day of her secondary school classes and also the final day of her ITP journey. 
                  After bidding an emotional farewell to the mixer panel that she had worked with for three years, she began to focus entirely on preparing
                   for the DSE and getting ready to embark on a new chapter in her life. The ITP journey had come to a sudden end, but her personal life chapter was just beginning.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">(Although in the end, neither Modo nor Hin achieved success, and the wrongdoers did not receive their just deserts—Sunny remained in his 
                  position due to his power within the school—Modo had personally experienced the harshness of the workplace and the ugliness of human nature over these three years. She
                   learned how to navigate the professional world, which had become a valuable lesson. During her time in ITP, she also discovered her future path. Given her strong interest
                    in the mixer panel, Hin encouraged her to pursue a goal in Creative Media at City University of Hong Kong.)</p>
