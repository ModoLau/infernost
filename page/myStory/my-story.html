                  Modo was unexpectedly assigned to on-site duty due to Mr. Yeung’s lack of oversight. She collaborated with Hin for the
                   first time and met Ms. Kwong, who was in charge of Hall A. The event concluded successfully, but unfortunately, many attendees were dissatisfied with their performance.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Since the beginning of 2022, Mr. Yeung’s behavior had caused dissatisfaction among many teachers and students. 
                  Over time, they began to associate the entire ITP team with his shortcomings, leading to misplaced anger directed towards them. Modo felt frustrated because if this continued, 
                  the ITP department might be disbanded. Having come to see this place as her second home, she did not want to lose her sanctuary. To change the situation, Modo decided to report 
                  everything to Ms. Lai, including matters regarding the <b class="itpfh">Form Head</b> list that has not yet been announced.</p>

                  The meeting primarily addressed the issues of order in the control room and behavior, 
                  subtly indicating to Mr. Yeung the responsibilities he should uphold. She announced that the new personnel appointments would be revealed on 2023/01/30.</p>

                   Additionally, it garnered positive feedback for ITP, particularly from Ms. Tang, who had previously been critical of the ITP team. She even praised Modo's outstanding performance to

                   especially in <b class="secret">Sunny's attitude towards Vivian.</b> For a moment, Modo thought they had become a couple, and she felt very awkward about this assumption.</p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">After the weekly assembly, Modo could no longer hold back and decided to ask Hin about the situation. Hin sighed, relieved that someone 
                  had finally noticed, and revealed to Modo the secret he had discovered:</p>
                  <p class="timeline-content-text"><b class="secret">Sunny was already married but was having an affair with Vivian, even taking leave together to travel.</b>
                   Although this did not concern the ITP team, Modo felt very disappointed in Sunny. Hin even advised Modo to stay away from him and exposed the fact that <b class="secret">Sunny was two-faced.
                    He appeared enthusiastic in inviting students into the server room, but when discovered, he would shift the blame onto others.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">At this moment, Modo decided to write a novel after graduation to commemorate the events of the past three years, titled <i><b> "ITP Survival Diary".</b></i></p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text"><i class="modo-feeling">Modo felt completely disillusioned with this workplace. She once believed that there could be genuine relationships in the workplace, but in reality, 
                  you could be stabbed in the back by someone and still thank them. At the same time, she felt angry about having to become two-faced herself.</i></p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">After class, Modo ran into Hin, who told her that he had informed Ms. Lai about everything. He also pointed out that <b class="camera">there was an unauthorized 
                  camera in the control room directly connected to Sunny's phone. </b> Ms. Lai was aware of it but lacked the ability to resolve the issue. At that moment, Modo had a bold idea: as
                  <b class="itpsh">School Head</b>, she had the responsibility to protect the privacy of every IT Prefect. She decided to find an opportunity to cut the power to the camera and shared this plan with Hin.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text"><i class="modo-feeling">Modo had always believed that this action was inappropriate, but when she found herself in a situation where even her supervisor could not help the team, 
                  she decided to step up and take action. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.</i></p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">After the morning assembly, Modo and Hin were the only ones left in the control room. Modo quickly covered the camera with paper and disconnected the power. 
                  She had a backup plan: if the camera had memory, they would know who the "culprit" was. Modo would explain that the situation was too chaotic, and she accidentally unplugged the power cord.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text"><b class="modo-feeling">In retrospect: Modo realized that she was no different from others in the workplace, all capable of playing “games”. Yet, she believed her actions were for the good of the team.
                   On one hand, she felt anger towards her own methods; on the other, she felt proud to contribute to the team.</b></p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">After the action, Hin informed Modo that Sunny had personally brought <b class="john">someone in last year to lighten the IT department's workload. However, that person upset Sunny, and he began to bully him at work, 
                  ordering him to replace the network cables in every classroom in the school. In the end, he even framed him to Ms. Lai, leading to his dismissal.</b></p>

                <p class="timeline-content-text">Modo had been diligently preparing for the DSE, and her ITP work was progressing smoothly. It was only after the event that she found a moment 
                  to chat with Hin about the recent developments. Hin revealed that one day, while entering the server room as usual, he had witnessed Sunny and Vivian engaged in intimate acts. 
                  That same day, he reported the incident to the principal, who subsequently reprimanded both of them. Upon hearing this, Modo felt a wave of discomfort wash over her. 
                  This meant that Sunny was now aware that Hin had uncovered his secret, and since Modo was part of the same team as Hin, she risked being implicated as well.
                   Yet, despite her unease, Modo felt a sense of resolve; she had anticipated that this day might come.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Hin mentioned that workplace bullying had been happening for a while; Modo just hadn’t had the chance to talk to him about it. Fortunately, 
                  after working diligently at the school for a year, Hin had built up a considerable network. So, when Sunny planned to resort to his old tricks to frame him, Ms. Lai could help 
                  protect Hin’s position amidst the rumors.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text"><i class="modo-feeling">Modo used to believe that it wasn’t necessary to establish connections with many people in the workplace, but through this experience, she realized the power of networking.</i></p>

                  After bidding an emotional farewell to the mixer panel that she had worked with for three years, she began to focus entirely on preparing
                   for the DSE and getting ready to embark on a new chapter in her life. The ITP journey had come to a end, but her personal life chapter was just beginning.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="timeline-content-text">Although in the end, neither Modo nor Hin achieved success, and the wrongdoers did not receive their just deserts—Sunny remained in his 
                  position due to his power within the school—Modo had personally experienced <b class="modo-experience">the harshness of the workplace and the ugliness of human nature over these three years. She
                   learned how to navigate the professional world, which had become a valuable lesson.</b> During her time in ITP, she also discovered her future path. Given her strong interest
                    in the mixer panel, Hin encouraged her to pursue a goal in Creative Media at City University of Hong Kong.</p>

                <p>A teacher joined FLSS when Modo in Form 4 and immediately stirred up a lot of controversy. Eager to rise quickly, 
                  he actively took over the ITP team. However, due to his irresponsibility and poor attitude towards others,
                   he made many teachers and students dislike him within just two months, severely affecting the order and reputation of the ITP team.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After Modo graduating, with no one monitoring his behavior, the ITP team effectively became defunct. He then transferred to "harm" Campus TV, as the ITP team held no value for him anymore.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Even now, despite receiving a large volume of complaints, he still works at the school.</p>

                <p>Three years ago, the entire ITP was handed over to Mr. Yeung, which led to a decline in the team’s performance. 
                  After <b class="secret">Sunny's secret</b> was exposed, she took back control of the team and initiated reforms, even helping Hin retain his

                  <p>Before becoming a teacher, she worked as a researcher, so she is used to wearing a white

                <p>Modo's close friend, Hin. After working diligently at the school for a year, he has built a 
                  substantial network. However, he feels frustrated by the school's focus solely on academics, 
                  neglecting other areas of development. Following the Sunny incident, he even considered leaving
                   the school. Ultimately, it was the collective support from others that helped him decide to stay.</p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Despite the fact that Hin is the IT manager at the school, he is primarily responsible for filming projects.
                    So his style is more casual. But he often feels insecure about not being a teacher, which makes him appear 
                    serious and burdened. He tends to be somewhat aloof and rarely smiles.</p>

            I’ll take them all away and only return them on the day we go back to Hong Kong."</b> I felt she wasn’t 
            joking, but the problem was that other classmates had bought snacks too—why was I the only one being 
            scolded? That night, unexpectedly, the three teachers in charge of the exchange program burst into my 
            room and took away another classmate, forcing me to face their questioning alone. They demanded I unpack
            my luggage for inspection and even <b class="mem-scene"> coerced me into calling my family to falsely accuse me</b>. I felt
            utterly helpless and could only apologize to them, feeling very wronged. When I mentioned a souvenir 
            I bought for my cousin,<b class="mem-scene"> they immediately laughed at his name</b>, believing I was lying.</p>

          <p>However, on the last day of the program, we went to the local supermarket one last time to buy 
            souvenirs. I was just short of money to buy a box of snacks, and since there was no mention of not allowing borrowing money at the project preparation meeting
            , I borrowed from my best friend. She agreed, but as soon as those three teachers saw me talking to someone else, <b class="mem-scene">they rushed over,
              grabbed my arm tightly, and forced me to look at her while answering her questions</b>. I was 
              terrified and stammered my responses, ultimately saying one wrong thing. That was enough for 
              her to accuse me of lying.<b class="mem-scene"> She even whispered in my ear, "If you lie again, I’ll tell all the 
              teachers and students at the school about your deceit."</b> At that moment, over 40 classmates were 
              curious about what was happening. In the end, I could only wrongly “admit” to lying, which seemed 
              to satisfy them. When it came time to pay, as I took out my money,<b class="mem-scene"> they loudly exclaimed,
              “Looks like someone doesn’t have enough money!”</b></p>

          <p>Back at school, it was they who broke their promises.
            A teacher who had previously been familiar with me suddenly
              changed her attitude 180 degrees. The position of discipline 
              captain, which was originally supposed to be mine, was suddenly
              given to someone else. Clearly, they had informed all the teachers in the staff room about me.</p>
          <p>Since then,<b class="reason"> I have yearned for power. I suppose I wanted to make up for the regrets of my primary school 
            days</b>. So when I learned about the IT Prefect position in the first year of secondary school, I wanted to apply. 
            However, due to grade restrictions, I had to wait until form 4 to officially<b class="reason"> pursue the dream I had in primary 5</b>.</p>
